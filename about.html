            <h2>Bio</h2>
            <p>
                Janiya Richardson is a third-year computer science and engineering student from Tallahassee, Florida. 
                She is in the dual degree engineering program pursuing her bachelor's degree in computer science at Spelman College and her bachelor's degree in computer engineering at Georgia Tech. 
                Her academic career goal is to earn a masters in robotics and a PhD in AI to research solutions to assist those with disabilities. 
                As a result of this research, she wants to create an assistive technology startup. 
                Before pursuing graduate degrees in artificial intelligence and robotics and building a startup based on her research, she was particularly interested in researching the ethics of artificial intelligence, especially when it comes to the bias of AI and how it negatively impacts minorities. 
                With robotics, she wants to explore how to use robotics to develop intelligent systems with assistive technology for those with disabilities. 
                She chose to study computer science and computer engineering because these fields provide the foundational knowledge and skills necessary to achieve her goals. 
                The intersection of these disciplines allows me to understand intelligent systemsâ€™ software and hardware aspects, which is crucial for developing comprehensive assistive technologies.
