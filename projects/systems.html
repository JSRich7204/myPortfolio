            <h2>Spelman College Self-Guided Tour System: A Systems Engineering Approach</h2>
            <p>
                This team-based project aimed to create a self-guided system using a microcontroller system for users wanting to tour Spelman College.
            </p>
            <p>
                The project involved designing and implementing a system that would allow users to navigate the campus independently, providing them with information about various locations and points of interest. The system was developed using a microcontroller, which served as the central processing unit for the project. The team worked collaboratively to design the hardware and software components of the system, ensuring that it met the needs of users while also being user-friendly and efficient. This project provided valuable experience in systems engineering, project management, and teamwork.
                The self-guided tour system was designed to be portable and easy to use, allowing users to access information about the campus at their own pace. The system included features such as GPS navigation, audio guides, and interactive maps, making it a comprehensive tool for exploring Spelman College. 
                 My role in this project as a programmer involved working with a team to develop the software components of the self-guided tour system. I was responsible for programming the microcontroller, integrating the GPS navigation system, and developing the user interface for the application. 
                 This experience allowed me to apply my programming skills in a practical setting and gain hands-on experience in systems engineering. I also collaborated with my team members to troubleshoot and optimize the system, ensuring that it functioned smoothly and met user needs. 
                 Additionally, I was chosen to present the results at the Spelman College Research Symposium.
                 Overall, this project provided me with valuable insights into the complexities of systems engineering and the importance of collaboration in achieving project goals.
