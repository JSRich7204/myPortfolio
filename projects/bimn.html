            <h2>Structural Engineering of (Bi/Mn) Double Perovskites</h2>
            <p>
                The FAMU-FSU College of Engineering is a joint engineering school for Florida A&M and Florida State universities, renowned for its cutting-edge research.  The internship was funded through the Minority Serving Institution Partnership Program (MSIPP). This project focuses on the structural engineering of (Bi/Mn) double perovskites, which are materials with potential applications in various fields, including electronics and energy storage. The research involves synthesizing these materials and characterizing their structural properties using advanced techniques such as X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy.
            </p>
            <p>
                The goal is to understand how the structural properties of these materials can be tuned to enhance their performance in specific applications. This research is part of a broader effort to develop new materials with improved properties for use in advanced technologies.
                During my internship at FAMU-FSU College of Engineering, I worked on this project under the guidance of Dr. Tarik Dickens. I was responsible for synthesizing the materials and conducting experiments to analyze their structural properties. This experience has deepened my understanding of materials science and its applications in engineering.
                From this, I prepared and presented a research poster, two gate Reviews, and developed a business idea pitch based on the reseach I conducted. The business idea was to create a startup that focuses on developing and commercializing a photodector that can be placed in smart watches to detect medical emergencies. The photodector would use the infrared light to detect changes in the skin and alert the user of any medical emergencies. 
                The startup would focus on developing this technology and bringing it to market, with the goal of improving healthcare and safety for individuals with disabilities.
